## What's up! I am BackupMiles 👏

Nice to meet you!\
\
I am a curious Software Engineer, mainly working with Node, C#, Rust, React, Typescript and Next.\
When I'm done working, I dedicate a lot of time developing and designing my games.\
I mainly use Unity and Unreal Engine 5, but I do have a game jam project done with Bevy, and some really short ones with Godot.\
\
Feel free to have a look around! 🚢
